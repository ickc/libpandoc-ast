# panir

pandoc's intermediate representation (pan + IR): the document AST every
pandoc reader produces and every writer consumes, for other languages, generated from
[pandoc-types](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types) rather than written by
hand: types, pandoc's JSON encoding, checks with useful errors, and filters.

It needs neither pandoc nor [libpandoc](https://github.com/ickc/libpandoc):
a filter written with it runs under `pandoc --filter`, and in-process with
libpandoc's bindings, unchanged.

| language | status | package |
|---|---|---|
| Python | working | [`python/`](python/): `panir` on PyPI (not yet published) |
| Rust | prototype | [`rust/`](rust/): crate `panir` |
| TypeScript | prototype | [`ts/`](ts/): npm `panir`, browser and Node.js |
| Julia | prototype | [`julia/`](julia/): `Panir.jl` |

Each follows its language's idioms, from the same schema:

| | nodes | wrong value | filter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | a class per constructor, checked fields and lists | `ASTTypeError` where it happens | `@f.on(Header)` functions |
| Rust | enums, structs with named fields | doesn't compile | a `Filter` trait (Lua's functions); `VisitMut` |
| TypeScript | plain objects, discriminated by `t` | `ASTTypeError` from constructors and `serialize` | `{ Header(h) {...} }`, as Lua filters |
| Julia | a struct per constructor, abstract type per sum | Julia's own `MethodError` | a method per node type |

Every one of them runs as `pandoc --filter`, and runs filters as pandoc runs
Lua filters, in the three orders filter frameworks use: typewise (Lua's
default), top-down (Lua's option, pandocfilters), bottom-up (panflute).

## How it stays in sync with pandoc

```
pandoc-types ──(haskell/, Template Haskell)──> schema/reified.json
             ──(QuickCheck, pandoc-types' own)─> corpus/arbitrary.jsonl
schema/reified.json ──(tools/derive.py)──> schema/pandoc-ast.json, corpus/invalid.jsonl
schema/pandoc-ast.json ──(tools/gen_<language>.py)──> each language's declarations
```

- **`schema/reified.json`**: pandoc-types' declarations, read at compile time
  from pandoc-types itself. An unknown kind of type stops the build.
- **`schema/pandoc-ast.json`**: what every binding generates from. It adds
  what the declarations don't say, decided once for all languages: field
  names (pandoc's Lua API's where it has them), how each type is encoded in
  JSON, defaults, which field constructors take as varargs. `tools/derive.py`
  documents the rules, and fails rather than guesses when pandoc-types changes
  beyond them.
- **The corpus** is the contract. `arbitrary.jsonl` holds random documents
  that pandoc-types' own aeson instances encoded, covering every
  constructor; every binding must decode and re-encode each one unchanged.
  `invalid.jsonl` holds documents each binding must reject, each with the
  path of the offending value (in field names, and in the JSON), which the
  binding must report. `pandoc.jsonl`
  is pandoc's own output for `corpus/*.md`.
- **Filters are checked against pandoc's Lua filters.** Each
  `corpus/filters/NAME.lua` is a scenario (replacing, splicing, typewise
  and topdown order, list functions, skipping children...), and
  `filters.jsonl` holds what pandoc made of a document with it
  (`scripts/filters-corpus.sh`). Each binding writes the scenario as its
  own filter, which must make exactly the same document. Scenarios marked
  stateless must also make it bottom-up, an order pandoc's Lua lacks. So
  far: TypeScript, Python, Julia and Rust.
- **Each language** generates declarations only (classes, fields, encodings)
  and has a small hand-written, generic runtime that reads them. Nothing in a
  runtime names a pandoc type, except helpers like `stringify`.

When pandoc-types changes: bump `pins.env`, run `scripts/generate.sh`, and
read the diff.

## Layout

- `haskell/`: the tool that writes `reified.json` and `arbitrary.jsonl`
  (depends on pandoc-types only; builds in about a minute)
- `schema/`, `corpus/`: generated, committed; CI checks they are current
- `tools/`: `derive.py`, and a generator per language
- `python/`, `rust/`, `ts/`, `julia/`: the packages

BSD-3-Clause, like pandoc-types, which the schema is derived from. The
generated code depends on neither pandoc nor libpandoc (which are GPL).
